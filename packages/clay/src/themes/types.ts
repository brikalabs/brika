/**
 * Shape of a Clay theme preset.
 *
 * A theme is plain data — JSON in `./presets/*.json` for first-party themes,
 * or a literal `ThemeConfig` from consumer code. `applyTheme(theme, mode)`
 * (in `./apply.ts`) injects a `<style>` tag with `:root` and dark-mode rules
 * derived from the theme. `themeToCssVars(theme, mode)` returns the same
 * CSS variables as a React-style object for scoped overrides.
 *
 * Every section is optional. The smallest valid theme provides only the
 * required identification fields; the existing 11 first-party themes only
 * fill in `colors`. New themes can opt into geometry, borders, typography,
 * motion, focus, and per-component overrides to fully re-skin the library.
 *
 * Token naming conventions:
 *   colors.{light,dark}.<token>  — kebab-case CSS var name, e.g. `card-foreground`.
 *   geometry.<prop>              — camelCase, e.g. `fontSans`.
 *   borders.<prop>               — camelCase.
 *   motion.<prop>                — camelCase.
 *   focus.<prop>                 — camelCase.
 *   components.<name>.<prop>     — `<name>` is kebab-case (matches CSS),
 *                                  `<prop>` is camelCase. The walker emits
 *                                  `--<name>-<kebab(prop)>` as the CSS var.
